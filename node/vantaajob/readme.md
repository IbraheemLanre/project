# CONSUMING EXTERNAL API 
This project consumes an external api and shows the available jobs in vantaa. 

The idea here is having both frontend webpages and backend in the different folder and using cross-origins. The version 2 looks at having frontend webpages and backend in same folders and serving the webpages from the backend without using cross-origin.

It renders the amount of jobs available in all sectors in a bar chart using a canvas in html.
