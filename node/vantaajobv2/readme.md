# CONSUMING EXTERNAL API

This project consumes an external api and shows the available jobs in vantaa.

This version is the same as version 1 but looks at having frontend webpages and backend in same folders and serving the webpages from the backend without using cross-origin.

It renders the amount of jobs available in all sectors in a bar chart using a canvas in html.
