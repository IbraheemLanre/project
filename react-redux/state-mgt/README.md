# State Management in React Using Context

This project takes a deep look into state management in a react app. As applications become bigger there is a need to use a centralized state management library which is different from React Hooks and React class Management. Using React Context, data can be shared across an application without additional third-party tools and with a small amount of configuration, React Context prvoides a light-weight alternative to Redux.
